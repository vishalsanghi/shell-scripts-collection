## Collection of Shell Scripts

This repo is a collection of various generic Shell Scripts. I will keep on adding new scripts as and when I get new usecases to automate simple tasks.

Used in Ubuntu / Debian based linux versions.

*Till then stay tuned...*

**The current collection scripts contains:**

* Git Setup - Git Installation, Removal and First Time Setup
* Git Commit - Automation of normal Git Commit. Git Comments, Pre-defined Username and Git Commit Commands

**Key Points & Assumptions:**

* Each script has its own directory with main script and config file in the git branch.
* Passing correct values from user interface or from the configuration file.
* You can change the config file name as needed but please ensure to modify the source in the main script file too.
* Scripts has lot of customizations please make use of it as needed.                                                                                

**Disclaimer:**

* Author does not take any responsibility of your data loss or any configuration loss.
